  The effect of word predictability on processing difficulty has been a central topic of investigation in psycholinguistics. Here, we use a broad coverage reading corpus in English to examine three language processing regimes that are common in daily life but have not been addressed with respect to this question: information seeking, repeated processing, and the combination of the two. Using standard, reading regime agnostic surprisal estimates, we find that the prediction of surprisal theory regarding a logarithmic relation between word predictability and processing time extends to these regimes. However, when examining surprisal estimates using regime-specific contexts, we also obtain two findings which are at odds with the predictions of surprisal theory. First, we find that in information seeking, such estimates do not improve the predictive power of processing times compared to surprisals from standard regime-agnostic contexts. Further, repeated presentation contexts yield near zero surprisal estimates with null effects on repeated processing times. These results suggest a misalignment of memory and context representation mechanisms between humans and current language models.

summary: This study investigates the impact of word predictability on processing difficulty in different reading contexts, including information seeking and repeated processing. While general predictions about the relationship between word predictability and processing time hold, specific contexts reveal discrepancies with surprisal theory, indicating potential misalignments between human cognitive mechanisms and existing language models.
